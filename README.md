# War Gob
## Design principals
- All rolls are always using the d20.
- Game is designed around a 2’ - 3’ board using miniatures.
- The scale is such that 1” on the board is considered to be 5’ in the game world.
- Each player will have a main character but may also have followers.

### Dice Rolls
Whenever a roll is made higher values are better. A natural roll of a 20 will always result in a good outcome while a 1 will always result in a bad outcome.
