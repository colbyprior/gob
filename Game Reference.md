### Level up point allocation
Level up points are awarded at discretion by the DM. Whenever a player gains one level up point during a session their followers gain half of one point.

Each level up point can be allocated for one of the following:
- Increase MOVE / STR / AGI / WON by 1
- Gain one spell or skill
- Increase HP by 2

The same attribute increase cannot be picked twice in a row.

### Maximum stat values
The maximum stats from level ups are as follows. Values can go higher from magic items except for armour which is capped.

| Move | STR | AGI | WON | AR  | HP  |

## Followers
Each player may have a number of followers corresponding to the number of players.

| 4+           | 1              |

### Recruiting new followers
Each follow starts with the following:
- The attributes as the players heroes.
- Only one starting level up point
- 20gp to spend on equipment per follower

## Encounters
### Round
Players act together and enemies act together. Instigating party goes first.

### Turn
Each unit gets a move action and a standard action.

**Move:** Move that number of inches on the board. One inch may be sacrificed for minor actions like opening a door.

**Standard:** Attacking, casting spells etc. A standard action can be used to move again however the second move only counts as half distance.

1. First all units take their move action simultaneously.
2. Afterwards resolve standard actions of each unit in any order.

## Combat
### Melee combat
The attacker and the target of the attack both roll their strength skill. Whoever got higher wins the combat. If there is a tie then both units win the combat simultaneously.

The combat winner then adds any damage modifiers to their roll. This is then considered to be their total damage.

The loser subtracts their armour from the damage they are given, remaining damage is dealt to their HP total.

The combat winner can then either choose to stay engaged with the other unit or shove the other unit back 1 inch. If it’s the combat winner's turn and they have not yet used their move action they may now move.

### Ranged combat
The attacker and the target of the attack both roll their agility skill. If the attacker rolled higher then they win the combat. If the defender rolls higher then the attack is a miss.

Defenders get a +2 bonus if part of their figure is in cover or a +4 if most of their figure is in cover. Defenders get a -2 if they are of size large.

The combat winner then adds any damage modifiers to their roll. This is then considered to be their total damage.

The loser subtracts their armour from the damage they are given, remaining damage is dealt to their HP total.

If you shoot at a target that is engaged in combat then roll randomly to see who in the combat receives the attack.

### Magic
Each spell has a set difficulty, roll your wonder skill and if you get equal or higher than the spell difficulty you cast the spell.

If you fail to cast a spell you may sacrifice HP to increase your wonder roll up to the spell difficulty at a ratio of one to one as many times as you have HP.

If you fail to cast a spell, take one damage.

If a creature is required to roll a save against your spell the total casting roll you made is the DC they must get equal to or higher to save. You can sacrifice HP to increase your DC as per normal spell sacrifice.

Given time and safety or succeeding on a spell by 5 or more, PCs can enhance a spell’s impact (e.g., affecting multiple targets, increasing its power, etc.) without any additional cost.

## Special effects
### Engaged
Units are considered engaged when their bases are touching. When a unit is engaged they may not move, shoot or cast spells.

### Outnumbered bonus
If multiple combatants are all engaged in a connected combat there may be an outnumbered bonus. Each side counts up the number of engaged combatants. The one with the most gets a +2 strength bonus for each unit they have more than the opposing side.
Eg. 3 units vs 5 units. The 5 units side gets a +4 on strength because they have two more units.

### Intercepting Movement
If a unit moves within 1” of an enemy that enemy may choose to force them to become engaged. If a unit moves within 1” of two enemies at once then only one may intercept the movement.

### Prone
If a character is prone they get a +2 agility to dodge ranged attacks and a -2 strength for melee combat. Standing up costs 1” of movement.


### Climbing / Jumping
If someone wants to climb a number of inches they must roll agility with the difficulty set to 10 + number of inches climbed / jumped. Climbing movement is halved so 1 move is 0.5”.

### Falling
If a character falls 2” or more roll agility with the difficulty set to 10 + number of inches fallen. If they fail they take damage equal to the number of inches fallen times two that is unblockable by armour.

### Grappling
To grapple a unit you must roll your strength versus the highest of the target's strength or agility. If you roll equal or higher then the target is grappled. When a target is grappled you may throw them 3” as a free action on your turn. Large creatures gain a +4 on grapple checks.

A grappled unit can be tied up as an action by using rope. Once tied the target may no longer take actions.

When grappled a unit may only attempt to escape the grapple by re-rolling the grapple check.

### Poison
If a unit is targeted by an attack with poison that ends up dealing at least one point of damage make a HP save. A HP save is a roll with your remaining HP added. If the result is equal to or higher than the attacker's damage then you are not poisoned.

If you are poisoned then you only get one action per round until healed. You may pick whether this is a standard or move action.

### Stealth
If units are out of vision they may move silently without provocation. If part of your movement or your action would cross the vision of units you will not want to see make a stealth roll.

To make a stealth roll, roll agility with the following bonuses:
+2 if part of your figure would be covered or +4 if most of your figure would be covered
+2 if you are further than 8” away
+4 if the unit is distracted

Of the targets that could see, roll wonder using the unit with the highest wonder stat. If the wonder roll is equal to or higher than the stealth roll it fails.

## Death and injury
### Recovering HP
Players taking a five minutes to rest fully recover their HP.

### Running out of HP
As soon as a unit reaches 0 HP, roll an injury roll on the table below.
Player characters get a +2 to this roll.
If the unit rolls injury and they already have an injury they stack. Injuries heal all at once.
If the unit is already injured they receive a -2 to the roll for each injury.

### Injury roll
| Injury roll | Effect                                                                                                                                         |

| 7-10        | Temporary Injury. This unit is unconscious and will have a -1 to all rolls until they have a full night's rest.                                |
| 11-20       | Recovered                                                                                                                                      |

## Equipment
### Equipment load
Max equipment load is 5 item slots. If a unit is carrying a large object they move at half movement.

#### Bulky
Bulky items take up two item slots.

#### Petty
Petty items don't cost an item slot to hold because they are small.

### Equipped weapons
A character may freely swap equipment at any time including on enemy turns. The only exception to this is a shield which takes a move action to equip or unequip.
